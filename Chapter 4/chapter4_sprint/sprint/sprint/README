                       SPRINT: Simple Parallel INTerface

SPRINT (Simple Parallel R INTerface) is a parallel framework for R. It 
provides a High Performance Computing (HPC) harness which allows R scripts to 
run on HPC clusters. SPRINT contains a library of selected R functions that 
have been parallelized. Functions are named after the original R function with
the added prefix 'p', i.e. the parallel version of cor() in SPRINT is called 
pcor(). Calls to the parallel R functions are included directly in standard R 
scripts.                      
                                
                                 REQUIREMENTS
 
Multi-core or HPC platform running:

*   R - latest version, SPRINT was tested using 2.15.1, 2.14.0, 2.12.1, 2.10.1, 2.10.0
        and 2.9.2.
*   MPI2 - any version will full MPI-2 support will work, although there are 
           complications when using non-gcc compilers. MPICH2 is preferred.            
*   Unix/Linux - SPRINT is designed for HPC systems and these all run on 
    Unix/Linux.
*   Mac OSX may be used instead of Unix/Linux. XCode command line tools 
	must be installed to provide C and Fortran compilers.
 
    
The ff package is also needed when using the pcor() function or when using 
SPRINT functions on ff objects, for example papply() accepts ff objects as 
input parameter. SPRINT was tested using ff version 2.1-1. ff is available 
from CRAN  (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ff/index.html).

There are known issues with open MPI parallel file IO support. SPRINT pcor() 
function uses MPI-IO and tests carried on an installation with open MPI 1.3.2 
on IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS) have shown inconsistent results. 
Sometimes wrong results were written out to file by one or more processes when
using pcor() on more than one node. The SPRINT team therefore strongly 
recommends NOT using open MPI 1.3.2.  

User access to HPC platforms will vary from service to service. The 
installation of software is likely to be limited to system administrators. 
Therefore help from your system administrator may be required to ensure that 
the required environment is set up on your HPC system. Running jobs is often 
only allowed through a batch queue system rather interactively. In such case, 
R scripts using SPRINT will need to be submitted to the batch queue using the 
appropriate utility specific to your HPC system (i.e. mpiexec, qsub). 
   
                                 INSTALLATION

SPRINT depends on several packages which must be installed first as follows:
> R
install.packages('rlecuyer')
install.packages('boot')
install.packages('e1071')
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("ShortRead")

SPRINT is distributed as a single compressed tar file. All source files are 
included in one single directory called 'sprint'. The installation process is 
carried out with a single command line from the directory containing SPRINT:

    > R CMD INSTALL sprint
 
If you are using a central installation of R and do not have the root 
privileges to install libraries there, you can install the sprint library 
locally by setting $R_LIBS accordingly.

   > R CMD INSTALL -l $R_LIBS sprint 
   
R tests if the installed package can be loaded during the installation. SPRINT
requires MPI to run and if you try to install it without MPI then the 
installation will fail. If you are installing the SPRINT library on a cluster 
where MPI is only installed on the back-end nodes but not on the front-end 
nodes then you may need to use the "--no-test-load" flag during the 
installation process. 

   > R CMD INSTALL --no-test-load sprint

optional arguments to the installation command: 

    --configure-args="--with-wrapper-script=$WRAPPER_SCRIPT"
where:

$WRAPPER_SCRIPT contains the compiler to be used for building SPRINT, e.g.  
"mpicc". The configure script automatically identifies the appropriate 
compiler for building SPRINT. This option should only be used if the script 
fails to locate the MPI compiler.
                                 
The SPRINT library includes a function to test the installation called 
ptest(). It simply prints a message identifying each processor in the compute 
cluster. For example, when using SPRINT with 5 processors and you will get the
following output:   
    
    [1] "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 0" "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 2"        
    [3] "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 1" "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 3"
    [5] "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 4" 

This is obtained by running the following sample R script, install_test.R:
    
    library("sprint")   
    ptest() 
    pterminate()
    quit()

    > mpiexec -n 5 R -f install_test.R
